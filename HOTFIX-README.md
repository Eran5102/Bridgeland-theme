# 🚨 HOTFIX: Theme Loading Issue Resolution

## Problem Identified
The theme failed to load due to a missing method `setup_webhook_handlers()` in the CRM integration file.

**Error Message:** `Call to undefined method BridgelandCRM::setup_webhook_handlers()`

## ✅ Fix Applied
The missing method and associated webhook handlers have been added to `/inc/crm-integration.php`.

## 🔧 Immediate Solution Options

### Option 1: Use the Fixed Version (Recommended)
The fixed `crm-integration.php` file is ready. Simply re-upload the theme.

### Option 2: Quick Emergency Fix via FTP/cPanel
If you can't re-upload immediately, access your website files and:

1. **Navigate to:** `/wp-content/themes/Bridgeland-theme/`
2. **Backup current functions.php:** Rename it to `functions-backup.php`
3. **Rename debug version:** Rename `functions-debug.php` to `functions.php`
4. **Your site should load** with basic functionality

### Option 3: Disable CRM Integration Temporarily
Add this line to the top of `/inc/crm-integration.php`:
```php
<?php return; // Temporarily disable CRM integration
```

## 🛠 Safe Installation Process

### Step 1: Use Debug Version First
```bash
# In your theme directory via FTP/cPanel:
mv functions.php functions-full.php
mv functions-debug.php functions.php
```

### Step 2: Test Basic Functionality
- Visit your website
- Verify it loads properly
- Test navigation and basic pages

### Step 3: Gradually Enable Features
```bash
# Once basic version works, restore full version:
mv functions.php functions-debug-backup.php
mv functions-full.php functions.php
```
